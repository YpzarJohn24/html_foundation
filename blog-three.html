      <h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>React</strong> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and
        open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
        based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
        community of individual developers and companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>React</strong>
        can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
        applications with frameworks like
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Next.js.</strong> Because React is only concerned with the user
        interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often
        rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key
        advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page
        that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM
        elements.
      </p>

      <h3>Angular</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a
        <strong>TypeScript-based,</strong> free and open-source single-page web
        application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a
        community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite
        from the same team that built AngularJS.
      </p>

      <h3>jQuery</h3>

      <p>
        In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side
        library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in widespread use,
        its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
      </p>

      <h3>Vanilla JS</h3>

      <p>
        The framework-like moniker <strong>"Vanilla JS"</strong> is term that
        has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at
        all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
